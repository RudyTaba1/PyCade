## most immediate to-dos
    -look up python best practices regarding oop
    -refine computer movements

## cleaning up later, after we get things rolling:
    -possibly seperate paddle/ball/main for readability
    -refine computer movements
    -add constants where appropriate (paddle dimensions?)
    -remove uneccessary variables if applicable
    -smoother graphics, sometimes the computer paddle stutters
    -easter eggs/cosmetics if I have time (disco mode on keypress where
        colors of elements change?)
