Welcome to Pycade! The Arcade features: Pong, Tetris, and Hangman.  All games are built from scratch, and are yours to play!

## Tetris
Take a flashback to 1984! Tetris is a puzzle game that utilizes different block patterns. Your goal is to fill a whole row with blocks! Whatever you do, do not let the blocks stack up all the way to the top!

Tetris has three difficulties that change the speed of the block fall.  Just like the old days!
